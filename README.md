# RECAP

I am grateful to have completed the Exploration page by applying key web development techniques:

 -[x] Used **WebP format** instead of GIF to optimize loading performance.  
- [x] Imported **Google Fonts** to enhance the user experience.  
- [x] Chose `<span>` over `<div>` for **inline layouts**.  
- [x] Applied **IDs** instead of classes for uniquely styled sections.  
- [x] Added the `text-shadow` property to improve text contrast.  
- [x] Built a **Hero section** to deliver a modern, engaging design.
